### introduction
While I have been working with React for years, this is my first experience with the nextjs platform. I had to pick up a lot of its particularities rather quickly. Also, while I am familiar with test-driven development concepts, I’ve usually left testing up to the QA folks - where I help them by answering questions that they may have, especially in testing my D3js work where adding data tags may be easier said than done. That being said, I’m confident that I’ve produced something worthy of my skills.

It is a not uncommon practice, on take-home coding interviews, so supplement the project assigned with as many extras as possible - sometimes including simulated login/logout to a webapp. However, being given explicit parameters for what was expected, along with a mock, I tried to come as close to those parameters as possible. To the extent that I did extra work, it was to create a structure that was suitable for an actual webapp. This includes things like setting up absolute referencing for imports relative to the top directory, building a themes directory and separating components and views (in this case, views being _pages_).
